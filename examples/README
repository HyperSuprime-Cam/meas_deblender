The "designdoc.py" code runs the deblender on real data to generate
the plots in the "design document", doc/design.tex.

Re: the files in "data":
  These example sims are generated by code in the Astrometry.net svn:
  URL: svn+ssh://astrometry.net/svn/trunk/projects/tractor/deblendTests.py
  and can be run (or, could be run in the distant past) via:
  python drivers/tractorPreprocess.py -v 2 -r 0 --debug --plots 2>&1 | tee v2.log
